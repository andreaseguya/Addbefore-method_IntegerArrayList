# Addbefore-method_IntegerArrayList
This was an assignment from my Intro to Data Structures class. The goal was to create  a method,"AddBefore" that is able to add integers to the beginning of the list instead of the end. We were provided with starter code which I will include in this repository as well as the actual instructions.
